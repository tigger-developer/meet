# meet

Branded 8x8 JaaS (Jitsi as a Service) meeting page. A lightweight Go web app
that serves scheduled video meeting rooms with a branded banner, room-scoped
moderator access, a shared meeting timer, and automatic meeting-artefact
archival.

Visitors go to `meet.example.com/workshop-april` and join a room. The moderator
generates a signed JWT URL via the CLI to get admin privileges and can start
recording from the banner. Video recordings are uploaded to Cloudflare Stream;
transcriptions, chat logs, and recording-link notifications are uploaded to a
Nextcloud WebDAV share.

## Quickstart

```bash
make init          # creates config/localhost.yaml from example
# edit config/localhost.yaml (addr, base_url)
# create secrets/localhost.yaml with 8x8-keys and recording secrets
# see config/localhost.yaml.example for the full secrets structure
make serve         # start the server
make token ROOM=my-room   # generate a moderator URL
```

## Dependencies

- Go 1.24+
- 8x8 JaaS account with API key
- Cloudflare Stream account (for video archival)
- Nextcloud instance with WebDAV access (for transcripts, chat logs, and
  recording-link notifications)

## CLI

```
meet                        # start the web server (default: serve)
meet serve --config ...     # start with explicit config files
meet token --room <name>    # generate a moderator JWT URL
meet moderator-link --room <name> --email <addr> --send
                            # send a room-scoped moderator magic link
meet --help                 # show usage
meet --version              # print version
```

### meet-helper (remote SSH shim)

```
meet-helper <host> <subcommand> [args...]
# Examples:
meet-helper light-hugger token --room workshop-april
meet-helper light-hugger moderator-link --room workshop-april \
  --email moderator@example.com --send
meet-helper light-hugger create --room demo \
  --from 2026-05-25 --at 19:00 --duration 2h
meet-helper light-hugger list --filter active
meet-helper light-hugger cancel --room demo
```

`meet-helper` ssh's to the named host and runs any `meet` subcommand there,
supplying the canonical deploy-time config cascade automatically.

### Makefile targets

```
make build          # build meet and meet-helper binaries
make serve          # build and run with local config
make token ROOM=x   # generate a moderator JWT URL for a room
make test           # lint + regression tests
make install        # symlink meet and meet-helper to ~/.local/bin
make sync           # git add/commit/pull/push
```

## Config

Three-layer config merged left-to-right:

1. `config/defaults.yaml` - universal baseline (committed)
2. `config/<host>.yaml` via `CONFIG_PATH` env var - host-specific overrides
3. `secrets/<host>.yaml` via `SECRETS_PATH` env var - secrets (age-encrypted for deploy)

The app reads `CONFIG_PATH` and `SECRETS_PATH` environment variables automatically.
The `--config` flag is still supported for explicit override. For local dev,
`secrets/localhost.yaml` (unencrypted, gitignored) is acceptable.

## Features

### Branded meeting rooms

Each URL path creates a meeting room (`/workshop-april`, `/writing-group`).
The banner displays the domain in Special Elite font with the subdomain
highlighted. Root `/` serves the default room (configurable).

### Meeting schedules

Rooms are registered with `meet create` and are joinable by guests only during
their window; a moderator JWT bypasses the window. Dates (`--from`, `--on`,
`--ends`) are bare calendar dates; the time-of-day comes from `--at HH:MM`,
required for every form except the all-day `--on`. Windows may be one-off (a
`--from` date and `--at` time with `--duration`, or `--on` for a whole day) or
recurring (`--repeat weekly|fortnightly|monthly` on a `--weekday` at `--at`).
Recurring rooms default to a 4-hour window opening 15 minutes early
(configurable via `meeting.default-duration` and `meeting.default-open-early`).
`--at` is interpreted in UTC by default, or in the IANA zone given by `--tz`
(`--tz Europe/Dublin`), in which case occurrences keep their local wall-clock
time across DST. Creating a recurring room previews its next occurrences, and
`meet list --room <name>` lists a room's upcoming occurrences; `meet list` on
its own shows current and future rooms. See `meet create --help` and `meet list
--help` for the full flag set and examples.

### Moderator access

`meet token --room <name>` generates a JWT URL with moderator privileges and
recording enabled. The JWT is passed to the 8x8 JaaS API client-side.

`/<room>/moderator` presents a Login page where a preapproved moderator
requests a room-scoped magic link. The page is available only while the room is
active; outside an active window it returns the same inactive-room 404 a guest
receives, so it cannot be probed to discover which room names exist. The
email-to-room relationships and SMTP credentials live in
`secrets/<host>.yaml.age`, loaded at runtime through `SECRETS_PATH`.

### Recording

Moderators see a Record/Stop button in the banner. Recordings use 8x8's
cloud recording infrastructure. After a meeting ends, 8x8 sends webhook
events to `POST /webhook/recording`. The server automatically:

- Downloads recordings, transcriptions, and chat logs to a local staging directory
- Uploads video recordings to Cloudflare Stream and records their playback URLs in
  `recordings.csv`
- Uploads transcriptions, chat logs, and Markdown recording-link notifications
  to Nextcloud through WebDAV
- Retries failed uploads with exponential backoff for up to 24 hours
- On success, moves files to an `uploaded/` directory for the configured local
  retention period
- On failure, files remain in `download/` and are retried on next app startup
- Names files as `{room}_{date}_{time}_{duration}.mp4` (recordings),
  `{room}_{date}_{time}_transcript.{ext}` (transcriptions),
  `{room}_{date}_{time}_chat.{ext}` (chat logs)
- Deduplicates webhook deliveries via idempotency keys
- Logs all webhook events for observability

**Prerequisite:** Register `https://<domain>/webhook/recording` in the 8x8
JaaS admin console with the desired event types and the bearer token from
secrets.

### Tile view

All participants are set to tile view on join. Participants can manually
switch back to speaker view if preferred.

### Shared meeting timer

Each room has a server-authoritative timer shown in the meeting banner.
Moderators can configure and control it; participants receive the same state
through server-sent events. The server emits time-based audio cues once per run
and sends a heartbeat every ten seconds to re-anchor clients. Timer settings
persist across restarts, while an active run does not.

Timer sounds play at full application volume:

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| Start or resume | `start.mp3` |
| Pause | Silent |
| Early warning | `warning.mp3` |
| Timer end | `end-timer.mp3` |
| Grace expiry | `over-time.mp3` |

An unmuted microphone is muted before playback and restored as soon as the
sound ends, without fixed padding. Already-muted microphones stay muted.
Overlapping sounds retain the mute until the last sound ends; intervening
microphone state changes cancel automatic restoration. Playback failure also
releases the cue's mute. Browser and system volume controls still apply.
